## Key Features Converted

### JavaScript Functionality → React Hooks

- **Page Navigation**: Converted to React state management with `useState`
- **Search & Filtering**: Implemented with controlled components and `useState`
- **Modal Management**: State-based modal visibility with `useState`
- **Form Handling**: Controlled form inputs with `useState`
- **Settings Save**: Button state management with loading states
- **FAQ Accordion**: Collapsible sections with `useState`
- **Scroll to Top**: Automatic scrolling on page change with `useEffect`

### Interactive Elements

- All buttons show console logs and alerts (as per original functionality)
- Search inputs log search terms to console
- Filter dropdowns log filter changes to console
- Modal forms handle submission with alerts
- Settings save button shows loading and success states

## Styling

The original CSS has been preserved exactly as `App.css` with:
- All original classes and styling intact
- Responsive design maintained
- Color scheme and typography preserved
- Animations and transitions working
- No visual changes from the original

## Browser Compatibility

- Modern browsers supporting ES6+
- React 18+ features
- CSS Grid and Flexbox support required

## Development Notes

- All components are functional components using React hooks
- State management is handled locally within components
- No external state management library required
- Console logging maintained for debugging (as in original)
- Alert dialogs used for user feedback (as in original)

## Production Considerations

For production deployment, consider:
- Replacing console.log statements with proper logging
- Replacing alert() calls with proper UI notifications
- Adding error boundaries for better error handling
- Implementing proper API integration
- Adding loading states and error handling
- Implementing proper form validation

## Original Files

The original files are preserved in the project root:
- `dashboard.html` - Original HTML structure
- `dashboard.css` - Original CSS (now in `src/App.css`)
- `dashboard.js` - Original JavaScript functionality (converted to React hooks)

This React version maintains 100% visual fidelity with the original while providing modern React architecture and maintainability.
